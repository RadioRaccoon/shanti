# shanti

Shanti is a staticmusic visualizer tool for generating unique visuals. 

Generate static and/or dynamic visuals of your music using a command line
interface or through a graphical user interface.

## Roadmap
Shanti is in the very early stages of development (i.e. nothing is ready at the
moment).

Development is focused on:
* File I/O
* Support of common audio file types (.mp3, .wav, etc.)
* Music visualization algorithms
* GUI
* CLI
